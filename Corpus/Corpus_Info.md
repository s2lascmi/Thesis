# Information on the Corpus

The zip file for the DHd conference 2023 was not publicly available at the date of thesis submission. Therefore, it is provided here only for further application in this thesis.

As the other zip files are too large to upload on GitHub and given that they are publicly available on Zenodo, the files are not provided here.
They have to be downloaded and stored as the original zip files in this folder in order to execute the Jupyter Notebook *MA_Preprocessing* successfully.
